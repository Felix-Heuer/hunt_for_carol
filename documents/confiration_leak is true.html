      Hi Team,

      We've become aware of a new article published early this morning on DailyTech titled "SHA2 Insider Claims: Unconfirmed Reports of Super AI Development."
      The story remains vague but directly matches our internal strategic roadmap.

      While the article doesn't quote any named source, the specificity strongly suggests it was based on our roadmap draft from late February.
      We need to identify the leak vector immediately and assess whether any NDA breaches occurred.

      Please flag any unusual document access activity and escalate this to your team leads. We're contacting DailyTech for comment but need to get ahead of this now.

      Best,<br>
      Alice

      Hi Alice,

      I've reviewed the recent access logs. The roadmap document was opened seven times in the last five days, including by a vendor account that shouldn’t have had access post-March 1.

      I'm forwarding the full log and screenshot from the DMS to the secure vault for your review. PR and Legal should be looped in—if the article gains traction, we'll need a controlled response.

      Could be time to reassess document-level security. What the f**k guys?!

      Best regards,<br>
      David Lim

      Hi All,

      Update: I reached out to my contacts at DailyTech. They claim the article is "based on public speculation and anonymous tips."
      I pressed further, and while they didn’t confirm, the tone changed when I mentioned legal action.

      They ultimately refused to remove the article, citing editorial independence.
      As a result, alternative—and rather costly—measures had to be taken to ensure the situation didn’t spiral.

      The article is still live but has been rewritten by PR. That’s something, at least.

      It’s clear that the roadmap served as a primary reference. The damage is contained for now—but it cost us. Next time we won’t be so lucky.

      @PR: We should discredit DailyTech additionally.

      Cheers,<br>
      Emily

      Hi Team,

      Appreciate the quick action, Emily.

      Honestly, we need to reconsider how we're treating these internal docs. Access should never have been that broad.
      There were warnings after Q1, and now this proves the point.

      Let’s lock things down going forward.
      Jeez, what happens if Carol finds out?!

      Hi Rajiv,

      Legal is preparing comms for leadership, and I’ll be reviewing it before it goes up the chain.

      In the meantime, let’s revert to segmented, offline versions of all future roadmaps.
      Syncs via cloud platforms are suspended until further notice. We’ll follow up with a policy draft by EOD.

      | Jeez, what happens if Carol finds out?!
      Let's hope she doesn't.

      All the best,<br>

      Hi Team,

      Agreed with Alice. This is a hard reminder of what soft policy invites.
      We need to codify new handling protocols for internal initiatives, especially anything tied to launch planning.

      I’ll start drafting revisions for our documentation SOP. Expect a draft shared folder by tomorrow.

      Best regards,<br>
      Mark

      Hi Alice and Rajiv,

      I totally agree with both of you—if Carol finds out, we could be in a lot of trouble.

      Let’s stay sharp.
