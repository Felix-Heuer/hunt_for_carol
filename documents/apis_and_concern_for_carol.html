  <div class="body">
    Hey all,

    Just raising this again: we still haven't switched off the debug API endpoints for signature verification.
      These were supposed to be sunsetted in January:

    Also—shouldn't we move away from that signature scheme with homomorphic properties?
      It's overkill now and potentially introduces complexity we don’t want.

    Oh, and while we’re at it, can we please kill the padding oracle leak in the legacy stack?

      - Debugging interface for signatures:
      - Debugging interface for padding in CBC mode

    Thoughts?

    Cheers,<br>
    Theo

    Hi Theo,

    Totally agree on the debug endpoints—they're a liability at this point. I’ll prep a decommission script for review this afternoon.

    I’m also in favor of dropping the homomorphic scheme. Unless someone has a use case to defend it, it’s just extra surface area.

    And yeah, the padding oracle is still an open wound. It’s not exploitable in prod (as far as we know), but let’s kill it anyway.

    Best,<br>
    Isabel

    Hey folks,

    Good calls all around. Let’s move fast on this—I'll coordinate with infra to disable the endpoints on staging first.

    Side note: has anyone heard from Carol lately? I pinged her about a crypto audit flag on Monday and haven't gotten a response.

    Cheers,<br>

    Huh—now that you mention it, I haven’t seen Carol in the SecOps Slack channel since last week. Was she on hold?

    Maybe someone should check with her, just in case.

    That’s odd. Carol usually replies fast, especially if it’s anything crypto-related.
    I’ll try her other work line again but it’s been going straight to voicemail.

    Let’s proceed with the cleanup efforts for now—I’ll keep you posted.

    Stay sharp,<br>

    Hey all,

    Just catching up here. I also sent Carol a note on Friday—no reply. No read receipt either, which is weird.

    Has anyone verified her daily check-ins recently?

    Nothing in the building logs that I can see. Last activity was… Tuesday morning last week?

    Starting to feel a little off. Someone from management looped in?

    Can confirm—last network login was seven days ago. No VPN activity, no workstation pings. That’s not like her at all.

    I’ll reach out to Carol’s assistant quietly and see if there’s anything we should know.

    Let’s not overreact, but yeah… keep your eyes open.
